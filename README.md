    The goal of evalstratified is to make an estimate of the 
    error fraction of a set of monetary files.
    This based on a level of certainty, and on samples of each of these
    files.

    ## Installation

    You can install the development version of evalstratified from
    [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:


    ``` r
      if (!requireNamespace("devtools", quietly = TRUE)) {
        install.packages("devtools")
      }
      devtools::install_github("cfjdoedens/evalstratified")

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
library(evalstratified)
```
